## Office 365

- Administration panel

When you are using Office 365, you will need to access your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).

- Create your SMTP Credentials

Office 365 uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, so you will need to set up an *application password* to authenticate with the SMTP server.

In the Microsoft 365 admin center, navigate to *[Additional security verification page](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info)* > Add sign-in method > App password

:::warning
Please, note that the password could not be shown after your close the tab, please be sure to copy the application password generated otherwise you will need to generate a new one.

- Authentication on Passbolt GUI

On your Passbolt instance, navigate to "Administration" > "Email server."

You will need to fill in your SMTP credentials to match your authentication method, remember, do not use the login credentials but the application password instead.
