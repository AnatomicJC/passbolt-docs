## Other

If you are using another smtp email provider or a local one, you'd rather use the **"Other"** email provider.

- Authentication on Passbolt GUI

On your Passbolt instance, you can navigate to *Administration > Email server*.

You will need to fill in your smtp credentials to match your authentication method, it could be:

1. Username & Password
2. Username only
3. None

Please, take into consideration that if you are using an email provider that doesn't require any authentication, you'll need to use the *none* authentication method, leaving empty fields with another authentication method could result in a failure to send emails.
