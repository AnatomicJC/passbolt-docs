## Sendinblue

- Administration panel

When you are using Sendinblue, once logged in, you will be automatically redirected to the administration panel dashboard.

You will need to navigate to *Your Senders & Domains > SMTP & API*.

- Create your SMTP Credentials

You will find your SMTP key value under the "SMTP Credentials" section. This key can be used to authenticate your email sending requests through the Sendinblue SMTP servers.

Sendinblue also provides the SMTP settings that you can use to configure your email client or application. The SMTP username is your Sendinblue account email address. The SMTP password is your SMTP key value.

It's important to keep your Sendinblue SMTP key value secure, as it can be used to access your Sendinblue account and send emails from your account. You should never share your SMTP key value with anyone, and you should take steps to protect your account from unauthorized access.

- Authentication on Passbolt GUI

On your Passbolt instance, you can navigate to *Administration > Email server*.

You will need to fill in your smtp credentials to match your authentication method (username & password).
