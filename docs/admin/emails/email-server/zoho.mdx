Please, be sure to save this password as you will need it to authenticate on the Passbolt GUI.

Your SMTP username should be the Zoho account email address and your SMTP password is the application password that has been generated previously.

- Authentication on Passbolt GUI

On your Passbolt instance, you can navigate to *Administration > Email server*.
