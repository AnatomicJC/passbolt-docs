<b>Step 5.</b> Enter the domains you want to allow to self register.

This section will require that you specify the domains you want to allow self registration on. This is used to only allow users with an email address at that domain to register.

Important: This will allow ANY user with an email address at that domain to register. So, it is recommended to not use a free or common domain such as gmail.com here.
