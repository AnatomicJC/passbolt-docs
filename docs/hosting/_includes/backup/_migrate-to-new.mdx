## Migrate the back-up to the new server
We will still consider that the backup files are in your user home directory ```~/backup```

### On the original server
Use a tool such as tar to compress the backup directory

```bash
tar -cvzf /home/backup.tar.gz /home/backup
```
You should copy the compressed backup file to the new server. Use a tool such as scp to do it

```bash
scp /home/backup.tar.gz 
new_server_username@server_ip:/home
```

### On the new server
The compressed backup file should appears inside your home directory, we will extract using a tool such as tar

```bash
tar -xzvf /home/backup.tar.gz -C /home/backup
```
The uncompressed backup file are now available inside your home directory.
