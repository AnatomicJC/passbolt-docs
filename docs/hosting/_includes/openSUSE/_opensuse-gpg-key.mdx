During the installation, you will be asked to accept passbolt GPG repository key. You must ensure the fingerprint is exactly the same as the one below:

```
  Repository:       Passbolt Server
  Key Fingerprint:  3D1A 0346 C8E1 802F 774A EF21 DE8B 853F C155 581D
  Key Name:         Passbolt SA package signing key <contact@passbolt.com>
  Key Algorithm:    RSA 2048
```

If the fingerprint matches, trust always by answering **a** to this question:

```
Do you want to reject the key, trust temporarily, or trust always? [r/t/a/?] (r):
```

Then, you will be asked for PHP repository GPG key, ensure the fingerprint is correct and trust it always:

```
  Repository:       php
  Key Fingerprint:  55CF 98B4 BB5B C6CC 2E24 748F 82EE 4011 CBCA 8BB5
  Key Name:         devel:languages:php OBS Project <devel:languages:php@build.opensuse.org>
  Key Algorithm:    DSA 1024
```

Finally, verify and trust openSUSE PHP extensions repository GPG key:

```
  Repository:       php-extensions-x86_64
  Key Fingerprint:  A85C D7EF 5242 1152 9A7F 994A 9B41 A048 1AF1 B065
  Key Name:         server:php:extensions OBS Project <server:php:extensions@build.opensuse.org>
  Key Algorithm:    RSA 2048
```
