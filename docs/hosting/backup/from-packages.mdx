## What to backup?

If you are a PRO user, ensure you have a backup of your subscription key.

There are also several elements you need to backup:

### 1. The database

We made a dedicated command in order to make a backup of the database, it uses mysqldump but we recommend to use the passbolt command as it has been made to avoid any pasting or logins details errors.

__Replace `WEB_SERVER_USER` with the correct one__. Depending on your OS, it could be nginx, www-data, etc.
```bash
sudo su -s /bin/bash -c "/usr/share/php/passbolt/bin/cake passbolt mysql_export" WEB_SERVER_USER
```

### 2. The server public and private keys

The GPG server keys are stored under /etc/passbolt/gpg/ folder:

* private key is serverkey_private.asc
* public key is serverkey.asc

### 3. The application configuration

Passbolt package stores all configuration files under /etc/passbolt/* but the one you need is /etc/passbolt/passbolt.php

### 4. The avatars

:::info[Since Passbolt 3.2]
User's avatars are no longer stored on disk but on the avatars table of passbolt database.
:::

Back up `/usr/share/php/passbolt/webroot/img/avatar` to avoid losing the profile images.

```bash
sudo tar cvfzp passbolt-avatars.tar.gz -C /usr/share/php/passbolt/ webroot/img/avatar
```
