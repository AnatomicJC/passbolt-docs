# How to preview a TOTP on Desktop

Since version 4.3.0, Passbolt supports creation of TOTP (Time-based One Time Password) via [Mobile](/docs/user/basic-features/manage-resources/totp/mobile). However, it is still possible to preview those TOTP from the Web UI

  }

/>

There are two types of TOTP:

- Standalone
  - That is the **Passbolt Community TOTP** resource, this is not linked to any passwords.
- Linked to an existing password
  - The resource **Passbolt** was existing before the creation of the TOTP and has been linked to it.

From the Web UI, you are able to preview any TOTP shown in the column “TOTP”
