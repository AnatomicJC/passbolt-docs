##  What are the main differences between passbolt resource permissions?

Passbolt offers three permissions at the resource level:

* <b>Owner:</b> can manage share settings, delete, update, read.
* <b>Update:</b> can update the record and delete.
* <b>Read:</b> can only read and use the password metadata and secret.

:::warning
A User with <b>Update</b> right is able to delete a resource. The main difference between <b>Owner</b> and <b>Update</b>
 right is the ability for the <b>Owner</b> to share a resource.

## What happens when you delete a user who is sole owner of a resource shared with a group or user? Does the group/user keeps access to this resource or is it deleted?


When a user, sole owner of a resource, is about to be deleted, a popup window is displayed and passbolt admin will be asked to transfer ownership of the resource to the group or user.

  }

  alt="Shared password ownership transfer"

If the deleted user was also the sole group manager, passbolt admin will promote another user of the group as group manager.

## What happens when you delete a user who owns non-shared resources?

Unlike shared ones, non-shared resources of a deleted user will be deleted as well.

## What is the difference between a group manager and group member?

The group manager is a group member who can add or delete users to a given group, and promote them as another group manager. No more, no less.

It is possible for a group member to share a resource he owns in “read-only” mode with the group. Group manager doesn’t have extra-rights to edit resources ownership.

## Who can create a group in passbolt?

Only a passbolt administrator can create groups on passbolt.
