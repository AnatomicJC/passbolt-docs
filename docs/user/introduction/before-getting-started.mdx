## Where is my passbolt URL?
:::info
The URL is selected by an administrator and as a user you will receive an **email invitation** from your admin to join.
:::

The URL you will ultimately use to manage your credentials may vary depending on whether your passbolt instance is
self-hosted or used in the cloud.

- If you're accessing Passbolt through a self-hosted setup, the URL will likely reflect the specific domain of your organizations,
for example passbolt.your-organization.com or your-organization.com/passbolt
- Conversely, if you're utilizing Passbolt through a cloud service, the URL will typically be cloud.passbolt.com/your-organization.

## What is the difference between admins and users?
Passbolt makes a distinction between **user** and **admin** roles. Users are invited by administrators to join an organization
and can use all the password management features provided by Passbolt to securely store and share passwords.

An admin also has additional responsibilities, such as managing user access, like configuring security
and user interface settings, and overseeing the overall administration of the Passbolt instance, ensuring smooth operation and
adherence to your organizational policies.

:::important
Because of passbolt multiple configuration options, your experience as an end user may vary according to your
organization's policy. If you are not sure why you cannot perform an action please contact your admin.
