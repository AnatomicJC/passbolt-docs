The recovery kit can be used if you are setting up passbolt on a new machine because you lost, upgraded or reinstalled the previous one. This procedure can also be used to configure passbolt on an additional machine.

## Requirements

You can follow this procedure if you are meeting the following requirements:

- You are in possession of an active account;
- You are in possession of your recovery kit, it contains a copy of the private key associated to your account;
- You remember your passphrase.

If you lost your recovery kit or your passphrase and you subscribed to the account recovery program, checkout this [documentation](/docs/user/quickstart/browser/account-recovery/admin-assisted-recovery).

## Procedure

**Step 1.** In order to recover you will need to go to your domain URL and add `/recover` at the end of the url, for example `https://yourpassbolt.com/recover`.

**Step 2.** Complete the form by providing your email address.

**Step 3.** Follow the link in your mailbox.

**Step 4.** Follow the recovery steps, which is much like the initial setup. You will need to import your private key.

**Step 5.** Enter your passphrase to login!
