## Quick clues

### If you have completed the setup

If you have completed the setup and configured passbolt on your current laptop or desktop, you can click on the passbolt icon in the top right corner of your browser.
If you then click on the passbolt logo it will take you to your passbolt workspace.

### Check for passbolt emails in your mailbox

In most cases you will have received an email notification from passbolt in the past in your mailbox.
So check your inbox and follow one of the links.

### Go on [www.passbolt.com](https://www.passbolt.com)

If you have completed your setup and configure passbolt on your current computer but you don't find the passbolt icon on your browser, you can go on [www.passbolt.com](https://www.passbolt.com).
On the very top of the website you will see a "Sign in" button you can click on.
This button will automatically redirects you to where your browser extension has been configured and you will see the login form of your application.
